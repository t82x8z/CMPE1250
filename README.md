COURSE OUTLINE 
COURSE NAME:  Embedded System Fundamentals 
COURSE CODE:   CMPE1250 
2024/2025 
COURSE DESCRIPTION 
Dedicated embedded controllers exist in vehicles, appliances, and electronic systems. A foundation in embedded controllers is essential for building and programming these systems. Students will learn to program an embedded controller and interface it to a variety of input and output devices. 
Course Credits: 3.00
Pre-requisites: CMPE1100,CMPE1300, CMPE1550
